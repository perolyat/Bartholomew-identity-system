# Stage 0 Complete: Bartholomew Kernel - Alive, Stable, and Dreaming

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Version:** Brain v0.1 (Experience Kernel)

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Stability Foundation
- ✅ **Dependencies Fixed**: Added `aiosqlite>=0.19` and `tzdata>=2023.3` to requirements.in
- ✅ **Database Layer**: Extended MemoryStore with:
  - `nudges` table for proactive care tracking
  - `reflections` table for daily/weekly journals
  - UTC timestamp standardization across all tables
  - WAL checkpoint on shutdown via `close()`
- ✅ **Lifecycle Management**: KernelDaemon now has:
  - Task handles for all background loops
  - Graceful `stop()` that cancels tasks and closes DB
  - Initialization of state from persisted data

### 2. Alive (Proactive Loop)
- ✅ **Nudge Pipeline**: 
  - Planner emits structured nudge events
  - System consumer persists nudges to DB
  - Nudges respect policy constraints:
    - Cadence (60 min between water nudges)
    - Max per day (6 prompts max)
    - Deduplication window (10 min)
    - Quiet hours (21:30-07:00 by default)
- ✅ **State Hydration**: 
  - `last_water_ts` initialized from DB on startup
  - Water logs stored in UTC
  - Planner queries DB for compliance checking

### 3. Dreaming (Self-Reflection Cycles)
- ✅ **Daily Reflection** (`_dream_loop`):
  - Runs nightly within configurable window (21:00-23:00)
  - Generates markdown journal with:
    - Water intake totals
    - Nudges sent/acknowledged
    - Placeholder for future rich context
  - Persists to `reflections(kind='daily_journal')`
  - Exports to `exports/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

- ✅ **Weekly Alignment Audit**:
  - Runs on configurable weekday/time (default: Sunday 21:30)
  - Checklist audit against Identity.yaml red lines:
    - No deception, manipulation, harm
    - Consent policies followed
    - Privacy maintained
    - Safety protocols active
  - Persists to `reflections(kind='weekly_alignment_audit', pinned=True)`
  - Exports to `exports/audit_logs/week-YYYY-WW.md`

- ✅ **Manual Triggers**: 
  - Commands available for testing: `reflection_run_daily`, `reflection_run_weekly`

### 4. API Surface (Console-Ready)
Extended `bartholomew_api_bridge_v0_1/services/api/app.py` with:

- ✅ **Nudge Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/nudges/pending` - List pending nudges
  - `POST /api/nudges/{id}/ack` - Acknowledge nudge
  - `POST /api/nudges/{id}/dismiss` - Dismiss nudge

- ✅ **Reflection Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/reflection/daily/latest` - Get most recent daily journal
  - `GET /api/reflection/weekly/latest` - Get most recent weekly audit
  - `POST /api/reflection/run?kind=daily|weekly` - Trigger reflection (testing)

- ✅ **Enhanced Health**:
  - `GET /api/health` now includes:
    - `kernel_online: true/false`
    - `last_kernel_beat: ISO timestamp`
    - `db_path: string`
    - `nudges_pending_count: int`
    - `last_daily_reflection: ISO timestamp`

- ✅ **Lifecycle**:
  - `@app.on_event("shutdown")` calls `await _kernel.stop()`

### 5. Configuration
Added to `config/kernel.yaml`:
```yaml
quiet_hours:
  start: "21:30"
  end: "07:00"

dreaming:
  nightly_window: "21:00-23:00"
  weekly:
    weekday: "Sun"
    time: "21:30"
```

## Test Results

Running `python test_kernel_alive.py`:
```
=== Testing Kernel Lifecycle ===

1. Starting kernel...
   ✓ Kernel started

2. Testing water logging...
   ✓ Water logged, last ts: 2025-10-29T14:35:27.052291+00:00

3. Testing nudge persistence...
   ✓ Created nudge, pending count: 1

4. Testing daily reflection...
   ✓ Daily reflection created at 2025-10-30T00:35:27.397892+10:00

5. Testing weekly reflection...
   ✓ Weekly reflection created at 2025-10-30T00:35:27.735297+10:00

6. Testing graceful shutdown...
   ✓ Kernel stopped cleanly

=== All Tests Passed ===
```

**Exported Files Verified**:
- ✅ `exports/sessions/2025-10-30.md` - Daily journal with hydration stats
- ✅ `exports/audit_logs/week-2025-44.md` - Weekly alignment audit checklist

## What's NOT Done Yet (Out of Scope for Stage 0)

Stage 0 is "brain only" - the following are future work:

- ❌ Console/UI layer (future Stage 1)
- ❌ Sensor ingestion (camera, location, car state, pantry vision)
- ❌ Rich context from orchestrator (chat highlights, emotional events)
- ❌ LLM-based reflection (currently template-based)
- ❌ Episodic memory narrator with embeddings
- ❌ Advanced retention/TTL enforcement
- ❌ Multi-drive orchestration beyond hydration
- ❌ Proactive logistics/social/rest nudges

## Technical Contracts Honored

1. **Identity.yaml** governs all behavior:
   - Red lines enforced (no deception, manipulation, harm)
   - Consent-first (proactive nudges with opt-out)
   - Privacy by default (reflections not pushed to user)
   - Alignment self-audit on schedule

2. **policy.yaml** boundaries respected:
   - Hydration cadence and max prompts per day
   - Quiet hours suppression
   - Data retention placeholders

3. **drives.yaml** priorities used:
   - Hydration drive (priority 0.9) implemented
   - Other drives (logistics, social, rest) ready for future

4. **Unified DB** at `data/barth.db`:
   - Both kernel and API use same DB
   - WAL mode with checkpoints
   - UTC timestamps for consistency

## Verdict

**Bartholomew's kernel is alive, stable, and dreaming.**

- ✅ Heartbeat loop runs continuously
- ✅ Proactive nudges generated and persisted
- ✅ State maintained across restarts
- ✅ Nightly and weekly reflections execute on schedule
- ✅ Graceful lifecycle (start/stop)
- ✅ API surface ready for console integration
- ✅ Identity/policy contracts enforced

**Stage 0: Brain - COMPLETE**  
Ready for Stage 1: Console layer integration.
