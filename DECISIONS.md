## Decision: Canonical SSOT docs (no doc sprawl)
- **Decision:** Adopt the canonical docs set as the only SSOT: `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `RISKS.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `INTERFACES.md`, `CHECKLISTS.md`, `REVIEWS.md`, `CI.md`, `TEST_MATRIX.md`, `PERF_BUDGETS.md`.
- **Alternatives:** Keep ad-hoc notes across multiple files; keep stage notes as SSOT.
- **Why:** Prevent drift; force dependency-aware planning; keep governance verifiable.
- **Consequences:** Legacy docs become references only; any new work must update the canonical docs.
- **Date:** 2026-01-19

## Decision: Fail-closed safety controls (parking brake)
- **Decision:** Maintain a persistent, scoped “parking brake” that can block subsystems at runtime.
- **Alternatives:** Soft disables; runtime flags only; rely on operator discipline.
- **Why:** Fail-closed beats wishful thinking. Enables safe expansion without trusting every caller.
- **Consequences:** All new subsystems must add a gating point + tests; operational procedures must include brake status.
- **Date:** 2025-10-30 (documented in `docs/SAFETY_PARKING_BRAKE.md`)

## Decision: Consent/privacy gates applied at the lowest retrieval layer
- **Decision:** Apply consent and privacy filtering inside FTS/vector stores by default.
- **Alternatives:** Filter only at orchestration layer; filter only at UI layer.
- **Why:** Defense-in-depth. Prevents accidental bypass by downstream callers.
- **Consequences:** Retrieval callers must support “context_only” flags and filtered result sets.
- **Date:** 2025-11-01 (documented in `CONSENT_GATES_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

## Decision: Single SQLite DB as shared persistence backbone
- **Decision:** Use a single SQLite database file for kernel + API (default `data/barth.db`).
- **Alternatives:** Separate DBs per component; Postgres; vector DB as separate service.
- **Why:** Simplicity, portability, low ops overhead for early stages.
- **Consequences:** Must manage WAL, concurrency, platform differences (Windows locking, SQLite build flags).
- **Date:** 2025-10-30 (Stage 0 completion)

## Decision: Identity.yaml governs behavior and policy
- **Decision:** Identity configuration is the primary governing document; policy engines enforce it.
- **Alternatives:** Hard-coded rules; multiple config sources.
- **Why:** Makes constraints inspectable, explainable, testable.
- **Consequences:** Schema changes are governance changes; require change control + tests.
- **Date:** 2025-10-29 (validation report)

## Decision: CI health baseline is Linux
- **Decision:** Treat Linux CI as the source of truth; quarantine Windows-only flakiness.
- **Alternatives:** Require Windows green; ignore platform issues.
- **Why:** Windows file locking and SQLite/FTS feature variability can create false negatives.
- **Consequences:** Must document quarantines and ensure real logic failures aren’t masked.
- **Date:** 2025-12-29 (status snapshot)


## Decision: Prompt-size discipline for agent execution (Cline)
- **Decision:** Do not paste full transcripts/exports into agent prompts. Treat large artifacts as files and process in chunks (map → reduce) to stay within provider rate limits.
- **Alternatives:** Paste everything into a single mega-prompt; rely on retries; switch providers only.
- **Why:** Provider token-per-minute limits and context limits make mega-prompts brittle; chunking is deterministic and verifiable.
- **Consequences:** Workflows must include chunking steps + intermediate artifacts; prompts reference paths, not raw blobs.
- **Date:** 2026-01-19

## Decision: Experience Kernel is a first-class subsystem
- **Decision:** Treat "Experience Kernel" (self-model + narrator) as an explicit module with tests and interfaces.
- **Alternatives:** Implicitly spread identity/self logic across prompts and ad-hoc memory.
- **Why:** Keeps continuity, growth, and persona coherent and testable.
- **Consequences:** Requires interface spec + replay tests; changes count as governance-adjacent.
- **Date:** 2026-01-19

## Decision: User Approval Gate for all doc/code commits
- **Decision:** No changes are merged or committed to the main branch without explicit user approval. This applies to canonical docs, implementation code, tests, and configuration.
- **Alternatives:** Auto-commit on successful CI; trust agent to determine when changes are "safe"; review-only for high-risk changes.
- **Why:** Maintains human-in-the-loop oversight; prevents unintended governance drift; ensures user understands impact of every change before it becomes permanent.
- **Consequences:** Every proposed change must be presented for user review before `git commit`; workflows must include explicit approval checkpoints; agent must pause and request authorization rather than proceeding autonomously.
