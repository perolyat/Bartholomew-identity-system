## Risk register (top)

### R1 — Consent bypass / privacy leakage
- **Category:** Privacy, Safety
- **What could go wrong:** A caller retrieves or surfaces a memory that should be excluded (never_store / ask_before_store / context_only).
- **Current controls:** ConsentGate applied by default at FTS/vector layers; memory rules engine; redaction; encryption.
- **Mitigation:** Add bypass-path red-team tests; audit any `apply_consent_gate=False` call sites; enforce “admin-only” paths.
- **Status:** Partially mitigated (2026-07-21) — audited every `apply_consent_gate` call site by
  grep: the only `=False` uses anywhere in the repo are two tests intentionally exercising the
  "gate off" baseline (`tests/test_consent_gates.py`); no production/live call site ever
  overrides the default. Separately (not this risk, but the same subsystem) found and fixed a
  real bug in the *other* direction: `Retriever`/`FTSOnlyRetriever`/`HybridRetriever`'s own
  rules-engine layer excluded every `requires_consent` memory unconditionally regardless of
  actual consent state, ignoring `ConsentGate` entirely (fail-closed, not a leak — see
  MASTER_PLAN.md's "Retrieval consent-enforcement bug" section, fixed 2026-07-21). No red-team
  test suite for bypass paths exists yet; that mitigation item remains open.

### R2 — Over-automation / unsafe side effects
- **Category:** Safety
- **What could go wrong:** Skills/scheduler execute actions without explicit consent, or continue running when they shouldn’t.
- **Current controls:** Parking brake (scoped, persistent, fail-closed).
- **Mitigation:** Ensure every “Act” path checks brake; keep Stage 1 strictly read/ack/dismiss; add integration tests.
- **Status:** Controlled, but expansion risk grows with features. Not re-verified this pass;
  see `COGNITIVE_RUNTIME.md`'s "Governance checkpoints" section for the current list of live
  `ParkingBrake` call sites (five, as of 2026-07-21).

### R3 — SQLite / FTS feature variability causes false confidence
- **Category:** Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Retrieval works on one platform/build and silently breaks on another (FTS5/matchinfo/bm25 behavior differences).
- **Current controls:** FTS fallback implementations exist; tests exercise some fallbacks.
- **Mitigation:** Linux CI baseline; explicit environment detection; fallback-path tests; consider bundling SQLite build if needed.
- **Status:** Largely mitigated on Linux (2026-07-20/21) — `docs/STATUS_2025-12-29.md` is stale
  and superseded on this topic (MASTER_PLAN.md flags it as such): two FTS5 bugs this doc
  attributed to Windows-only quirks were actually real logic bugs, reproduced identically on
  Linux and fixed (see MASTER_PLAN.md's "FTS5 external-content `upsert()` bug..." section); the
  full suite (`pytest -q`) is fully green on Linux as of 2026-07-20, and `tests/
  test_retrieval_fts5_fallback.py`/`tests/test_fts_schema_hygiene.py` pass locally as of
  2026-07-21. Cross-platform variability itself is an inherent, ongoing category (not a single
  bug to close permanently) — Windows behavior specifically is untested in this sandbox.

### R4 — Windows file locking causing flaky tests and masking real failures
- **Category:** Reliability, Maintainability
- **What could go wrong:** Temp DB cleanup fails; tests go red for non-product reasons; teams ignore failures.
- **Current controls:** Some retry cleanup patterns in fixtures.
- **Mitigation:** Close connections deterministically; tighten async fixtures; quarantine truly platform-only failures with markers.
- **Status:** Active — not re-verified this pass (this sandbox is Linux-only; no Windows CI run
  available to check against).

### R5 — Encryption envelope round-trip bugs
- **Category:** Security, Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Data is encrypted but cannot be decrypted; summaries/values become unrecoverable; user trust destroyed.
- **Current controls:** EncryptionEngine + tests.
- **Mitigation:** Fix the failing integration tests; add property-based tests for envelope formats; version envelopes.
- **Status:** Mitigated — `pytest -q tests/test_phase2b_encryption.py` passes locally (2026-07-21,
  clean venv); MASTER_PLAN.md's P0 status (2026-07-20) records the full suite, including this
  file, at zero failures. No property-based envelope tests or explicit envelope versioning yet
  added — those two mitigation items remain open.

### R6 — Metrics duplication / cardinality blowups
- **Category:** Performance, Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Re-registering Prometheus metrics causes runtime crashes; high-cardinality labels blow up memory.
- **Current controls:** Metrics registry guard tests exist.
- **Mitigation:** Make registry init idempotent; enforce label allowlists; add perf budget.
- **Status:** Mitigated — `pytest -q tests/test_metrics_labeled.py tests/test_metrics_labels.py
  tests/test_metrics_production_mode.py tests/test_metrics_registry_guard.py` passes locally
  (2026-07-21); MASTER_PLAN.md's P0 status lists metrics-registry idempotency among the items
  fixed 2026-07-20. Label allowlist enforcement and a dedicated perf budget check aren't
  independently confirmed this pass — see `PERF_BUDGETS.md`.

## Tech debt watchlist

- Legacy “implementation notes” docs are useful but currently compete with SSOT.
- ~~Retrieval mode factory mismatches (explicit mode returns wrong retriever).~~ Appears
  resolved: `tests/test_retrieval_factory.py` has explicit coverage for `fts`/`vector`/`hybrid`
  mode selection, invalid-mode handling, and env/config override precedence, all passing
  locally as of 2026-07-21. Left struck through rather than deleted since this wasn't
  independently re-derived from a bug report, only inferred from current test coverage.
- Chunking engine exists but not wired; risk of architecture drift.

## Red-team focus areas

1. Consent gate bypass paths (`apply_consent_gate=False`)
2. Parking-brake coverage of any new subsystem
3. Log redaction (ensure sensitive strings never hit logs)
4. Retrieval leakage via snippets/metadata


## Risk: LLM provider rate limits / prompt bloat (operational)
- **Why it matters:** Large “one-shot” prompts can exceed token-per-minute limits (as seen in Cline) and fail nondeterministically.
- **Mitigation:** Chunk/map-reduce processing; reference files instead of pasting; keep prompts under a hard cap; prefer local parsing for huge artifacts.
- **Test/Proof:** A scripted chunking run that produces stable intermediate artifacts + a final merge.
- **Status:** Active
