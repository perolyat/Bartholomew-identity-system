## Risk register (top)

### R1 — Consent bypass / privacy leakage
- **Category:** Privacy, Safety
- **What could go wrong:** A caller retrieves or surfaces a memory that should be excluded (never_store / ask_before_store / context_only).
- **Current controls:** ConsentGate applied by default at FTS/vector layers; memory rules engine; redaction; encryption.
- **Mitigation:** Add bypass-path red-team tests; audit any `apply_consent_gate=False` call sites; enforce “admin-only” paths.
- **Status:** Active

### R2 — Over-automation / unsafe side effects
- **Category:** Safety
- **What could go wrong:** Skills/scheduler execute actions without explicit consent, or continue running when they shouldn’t.
- **Current controls:** Parking brake (scoped, persistent, fail-closed).
- **Mitigation:** Ensure every “Act” path checks brake; keep Stage 1 strictly read/ack/dismiss; add integration tests.
- **Status:** Controlled, but expansion risk grows with features

### R3 — SQLite / FTS feature variability causes false confidence
- **Category:** Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Retrieval works on one platform/build and silently breaks on another (FTS5/matchinfo/bm25 behavior differences).
- **Current controls:** FTS fallback implementations exist; tests exercise some fallbacks.
- **Mitigation:** Linux CI baseline; explicit environment detection; fallback-path tests; consider bundling SQLite build if needed.
- **Status:** Active (see `docs/STATUS_2025-12-29.md`)

### R4 — Windows file locking causing flaky tests and masking real failures
- **Category:** Reliability, Maintainability
- **What could go wrong:** Temp DB cleanup fails; tests go red for non-product reasons; teams ignore failures.
- **Current controls:** Some retry cleanup patterns in fixtures.
- **Mitigation:** Close connections deterministically; tighten async fixtures; quarantine truly platform-only failures with markers.
- **Status:** Active

### R5 — Encryption envelope round-trip bugs
- **Category:** Security, Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Data is encrypted but cannot be decrypted; summaries/values become unrecoverable; user trust destroyed.
- **Current controls:** EncryptionEngine + tests.
- **Mitigation:** Fix the failing integration tests; add property-based tests for envelope formats; version envelopes.
- **Status:** Active (P0)

### R6 — Metrics duplication / cardinality blowups
- **Category:** Performance, Reliability
- **What could go wrong:** Re-registering Prometheus metrics causes runtime crashes; high-cardinality labels blow up memory.
- **Current controls:** Metrics registry guard tests exist.
- **Mitigation:** Make registry init idempotent; enforce label allowlists; add perf budget.
- **Status:** Active (P0)

## Tech debt watchlist

- Legacy “implementation notes” docs are useful but currently compete with SSOT.
- Retrieval mode factory mismatches (explicit mode returns wrong retriever).
- Chunking engine exists but not wired; risk of architecture drift.

## Red-team focus areas

1. Consent gate bypass paths (`apply_consent_gate=False`)
2. Parking-brake coverage of any new subsystem
3. Log redaction (ensure sensitive strings never hit logs)
4. Retrieval leakage via snippets/metadata


## Risk: LLM provider rate limits / prompt bloat (operational)
- **Why it matters:** Large “one-shot” prompts can exceed token-per-minute limits (as seen in Cline) and fail nondeterministically.
- **Mitigation:** Chunk/map-reduce processing; reference files instead of pasting; keep prompts under a hard cap; prefer local parsing for huge artifacts.
- **Test/Proof:** A scripted chunking run that produces stable intermediate artifacts + a final merge.
- **Status:** Active
