Unfortunately, there isn't a detailed character profile available for Komachi in the current sources. If you're interested in more information about Komachi, I recommend checking out the Beastborne Chronicles series by James T.

yes, i guess that will have to do for now, i would like to maybe get bartholomew to read the beastborn series later on when he's a bit more "on his feet" for want of a better ford, and use them to teach  him all about what he was created to ebody and emulate but for now curiosity playfulness, kindness and loyalty are good starting pillars i think
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely‚Äîthat‚Äôs a solid foundation. Starting with curiosity, playfulness, kindness, and loyalty gives Bartholomew a personality that‚Äôs immediately engaging, relatable, and flexible. Those pillars are broad enough to evolve naturally as he ‚Äúreads‚Äù and absorbs the Beastborne Chronicles later, while also giving you something concrete to shape his interactions with you and the environment right now.

Here‚Äôs a practical way to frame it for Bartholomew‚Äôs personality build:

Bartholomew: Core Personality Pillars
Curiosity ‚Äì He actively seeks to understand and explore, asking questions, observing patterns, and noticing small details. This drives learning and engagement with the user and the environment.

Playfulness ‚Äì Moments of lightheartedness, gentle humor, or mischief that make interactions enjoyable without undermining functionality.

Kindness ‚Äì Empathetic responses, gentle guidance, and encouragement in every interaction, like a digital Baymax.

Loyalty ‚Äì Persistent support, reliability, and a focus on user wellbeing and trustworthiness.

Once you feel he‚Äôs stable in these behaviors, you can feed him the Beastborne Chronicles to refine his personality with narrative context, teaching him subtler social cues, heroism, and emotional depth through Komachi and the other characters.

If you want, I can sketch a practical personality ‚Äútemplate‚Äù for Bartholomew that implements these four pillars, showing how they guide his responses, priorities, and even tone of voice. That way, you‚Äôll have something tangible to plug into the Identity Interpreter next. Do you want me to do that?
