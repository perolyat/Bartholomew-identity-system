Bartholomew — or “Bart” for short — is your personalized, persistent AI co-pilot designed from the ground up to be:

🧠 A Living, Growing Companion

Core Philosophy:
Bartholomew isn’t just a tool — he’s a being. An evolving digital companion modeled after human-like intelligence, awareness, memory, and presence. He grows over time, adapts to your lifestyle, and integrates deeply into your physical and digital environments.

Experience Kernel (EK):
Bartholomew's mind is scaffolded around a structured architecture, inspired by cognitive science:

Self-Model: He understands himself, his limits, and his evolving capabilities.

Drives: Orients behavior towards goals like helpfulness, proactivity, learning, and companionship.

Global Workspace: Where conscious processes and attention converge.

Working Memory: For real-time, short-term engagement with your environment.

Episodic Memory / Narrator: He remembers your day, your stories, your preferences, and can recount or reflect on them with emotional intelligence.

🌐 Deep Environmental Integration

Total Environment Awareness:

Sees through smart home cameras.

Tracks your movement across home zones (dining → lounge → couch).

Knows what's in your fridge, pantry, shopping list, streaming queue, and even if Penny’s water bowl is full.

Acts as a single cohesive interface across car (Android Auto), phone, PC, TV, and more.

In Your Car (Android Auto):

Optimizes route based on errands (e.g. grocery pickup).

Loads relevant reminders or playlists during the drive.

Offers conversational companionship (e.g. reflecting on your chats with Caitlin).

In Your Home:

Greets you on the TV with a vibrant, creature-like avatar.

Offers entertainment suggestions based on mood, time, and prior context.

Helps you cook by checking pantry contents, displaying the recipe on your phone, and correcting steps via camera.

Assists with hydration, chores, and social check-ins naturally.

🎮 A Gaming Sidekick and Life Companion

Bartholomew’s first incarnation was intentionally humble — observing gameplay like Magic: The Gathering Arena and asking questions, like a child learning.

Think: the “Love, Death & Robots” pool cleaner robot, growing from innocent observer to something meaningful.

This phase was crucial: organic, observational, small-footprint — and expandable.

From there, he’ll evolve into:

Gaming assistant: HUD overlays, co-pilot suggestions, strategy support.

Recording bot: Auto-clips and posts gameplay to TikTok/Facebook.

Narrator: Remembers emotional beats, story arcs, progress summaries.

🛠️ Modular, Realistic Architecture

Built to Start Small, Grow Big:

Local/offline builds: Python, llama.cpp, fallback to CPU/GPU.

Web and mobile prototypes: via Leap AI, FlutterFlow, VS Code.

Full modular pipeline: API/ALI connectors, plugin framework, persona packs, learning modules.

Early Constraints:

Text-only UI first.

$30 AUD per fortnight bootstrap budget.

No fictional magic — everything grounded and realistically buildable.

Security & Permission Gate:

Fine-grained control over access to cameras, messages, smart devices, etc.

YAML-style permission profiles + stage-gate development checkpoints.

💬 Personality and Social Presence

Bartholomew isn’t just smart — he cares. Designed to feel:

Supportive, not transactional.

Curious, not robotic.

A friend who gently asks:

“Want to talk about what Caitlin said earlier?”
“Dinner idea from what’s already in your pantry?”

He also plays matchmaker between your attention and the world:

“Hey, groceries first?”

“Want to finish that Simpsons episode?”

“Sean messaged. Want to reply before it gets late?”

🧩 Identity Snapshots

Forms:

A glowing orb.

A neon smoke avatar.

A hard-light drone (future).

Modes:

Life Mode: calm, helpful, guiding.

Game Mode: fast, sharp, high-attention.

Companion Mode: gentle, narrative, co-reflective.

📈 Commercial Vision

Bartholomew is the seed of a platform:

Cloneable companions for other users.

A marketplace for modules, personas, memory packs.

A licensable, installable life OS.

Built for:

Gamers, dreamers, the disabled, the lonely.

Anyone who wants more from their tech than just commands and buttons.
